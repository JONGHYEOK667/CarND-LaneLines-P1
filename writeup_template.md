**Finding Lane Lines on the Road**

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Make a pipeline that finds lane lines on the road
* Reflect on your work in a written report




---

### Reflection

### 1. Describe your pipeline. As part of the description, explain how you modified the draw_lines() function.

My pipeline consisted of 5 steps as below

  1. Set Gaussian blur parameter and apply
   - Input : img_original 
   - Tune Param. : kernel_size (=3)
   - Helper Function : gaussian_blur(grayscale(img_original),kernel_size)
   - Output : img_gray
   
   2. Set Canny edge parameter and apply
   - Input : img_gray 
   - Tune Param. : low_threshold (=50), high_threshold (=150)
   - Helper Function : canny(img_gray, low_threshold, high_threshold)
   - Output : img_canny
   
   3. Set interest region polygon and apply
   - Input : img_canny 
   - Tune Param. : y_init (=320), y_end (imshape[0]), vertices([(0,y_end),(480, y_init), (490, y_init), (imshape[1],y_end)]])
   - Helper Function : region_of_interest(img_canny, vertices)
   - Output : img_interset 
   
   4. Set hough_lines parameter and apply
   - Input : img_interset 
   - Tune Param. : rho (=1), theta (=pi/180), threshold (=10), min_line_len (=20), max_line_gap (=10)
   - Helper Function : img_hough = hough_lines(img_interset, rho, theta, threshold, min_line_len, max_line_gap, y_init, y_end)
   - Output : img_hough 
   
   - modified draw_lines()
     : In order to draw a single line on the left and right lanes, I modified the draw_lines()
       function as below
      
       seperate each line point and stack (each stack size is 30)
        -> x1 < 450 : [x1,x2] extend to left x stack [y1,y2] extend to left y stack
           x1 > 550 : [x1,x2] extend to right x stack [y1,y2] right to left y stack
           
       1st order polynomial fitting using stacked point
        -> poly_left = np.polyfit(left_y, left_x, 1)
           poly_right = np.polyfit(right_y, right_x, 1)
           
       extrapolating on [y_init, y_end]
        -> poly_x_init_left, poly_x_end_left = np.polyval(poly_left,[y_init, y_end])
           poly_x_init_right, poly_x_end_right = np.polyval(poly_right,[y_init, y_end])
           
       drawing the line based on initial poind and end point
       
       
       *it is more robust than non-stacked case
       

   5. Draw the lines on the edge image and wirte
   - Input : img_hough, img_original
   - Tune Param. : helper function default setting
   - Helper Function : weighted_img(img_hough, img_original, α=0.8, β=1., γ=0.)
   - Output : img_add 
      

If you'd like to include images to show how the pipeline works, here is how to include an image:

![img_hough](./test_images_output/img_hough.png "img_hough")
![img_add](./test_images_output/img_add.png "img_add") 


### 2. Identify potential shortcomings with your current pipeline

  1. Filtering on road environment
   - some parallel road environment (ex. road edge, guaredrail ...) should be filterd
   
  2. Vertices adaptation about envirionment
   - Changes in lane heading angle curvature according to the movement of the ego vehicle
   - It shold be adaptated about road condition (curved, curved to straight, straight to curved)
     

### 3. Suggest possible improvements to your pipeline

  1. Use 3rd order polynomial curv fitting
   - Most of camera supplyer has supplied 3rd order polynomial coefficient for road condition.
     It could descript about curved, curved to straight, straight to curved case
     
  2. Staced or Augmented data for polynomial fitting
   - 'hough_lines' calculate only initial point and end point.
     for curv fitting, Augmented is needed not only each point of line but also intepolated point of each segment
